# MetaMind 🧠

**An AI-powered application to instantly generate documentation and enable conversational search for your database schemas.**

## ✨ Features

MetaMind is a powerful tool for data professionals and developers, designed to accelerate the understanding of complex database structures.

-   **Dual Input Methods:** Supports both direct upload of **SQLite** (`.db`) files and pasting raw **SQL `CREATE TABLE` statements** for other databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL.
-   **AI-Powered Documentation:** Automatically generates comprehensive documentation for each table, including:
    -   A clear, one-sentence purpose.
    -   Detailed descriptions for each column.
    -   Relevant business tags for quick context.
    -   Actionable data quality check suggestions.
-   **Conversational Schema Search:** An interactive chat interface that allows you to ask follow-up questions about your schema in plain English.
-   **Secure API Key Handling:** A simple and secure interface for users to input their own API key, which is used only for their session and is never stored.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/metamind_project.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/metamind_project.git)
    cd metamind_project
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate

    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up your API key (for local development):**
    -   Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project folder.
    -   Add your Groq API key to the file like this:
        ```
        GROQ_API_KEY="gsk_YourSecretKeyHere"
        ```

5.  **Run the Streamlit app:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    The application should now be running in your web browser!
